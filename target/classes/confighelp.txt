This is description for config files for PcControl Server-Side App.

To be correct Yaml file, the config lines should look like this:
   
   something:
      sub-something:
         - first thing (with space after "-"!)
         - second thing
         - C:\
   some-settings: 1000
   (... And so on)
   
Example of actual usage:
   
   settings:
      folders-allowed-to-see:
         - all
      folders-and-files-allowed-to-use-execution:
         - C:\
         - D:\
         - G:\FirstFolder
         - G:\SecondFolder\
         - G:\ThirdFolder\app.exe
         - !G:\ThirdFolder\dangerous.exe ( <- will not be included)
         
In addition:
If you do something like this:

    folders-allowed-to-see:
      - "C:"
      - "G:/Unity"
      
You will not be able to go to G:\, but will be able go to "G:/Unity" if you request it's full path. So, usually you should also allow the higher folder(s) (or the disk)

Available settings:

   folders-allowed-to-see
   # What folders client will be able to see in the list and enter. Default: * (it means everything)
   
   folders-and-files-allowed-to-use-execution:
   # What folders client will be able to execute files in and single file directories. Default: some random thing after "- "
   
Attention!
Yaml has problems with \ symbol, but the app will try to replace it with / when loading the config, so that's why it happens
Also, if you put "yes", "no", "true", "false" without "" symbols somewhere instead of path, you will most likely break the code
Tabulation (placing text to the right more every time when entering a new section) is required in yaml files.
